# Password Generator

## What it is:

I've created a Password Generator using Javascript which will generate strings of random characters that fit the options designated by the user.

## How to use:

When the Generate Password button is clicked, the user will be prompted to specify:
- the desired lenght of the password
- if they want the password to include special characters (@, #, %, &, etc.)
- if they want the password to include numbers
- if they want the password to include capital letters
- if they want the password to include lowecase letters

and the randomly genererated password will print to the screen.
This can be repeated by pressing the Generate Password button again.
